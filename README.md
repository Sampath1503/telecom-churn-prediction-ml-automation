## 🚀 Project Overview

This system delivers a production-style churn analytics workflow:

* SQL-based data sourcing
* Feature engineering & imbalance handling
* XGBoost-based predictive modeling
* Automated batch inference pipeline
* Risk segmentation logic
* Power BI dashboard integration

The focus is not just prediction — but operational decision support.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

* ~10,000 telecom customers
* Binary target: Churn (Yes / No)

Key features:

* Usage metrics (day, evening, night, international)
* Billing charges
* Service calls
* Account tenure
* Plan subscriptions

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Engineered features include:

* Total usage aggregation
* Total charge aggregation
* Charge-per-minute ratio
* Service call binning
* International usage indicator
* Behavioral risk segmentation

Goal: Improve minority class signal detection.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

Model: **XGBoost Classifier**

Techniques used:

* SMOTETomek for class imbalance
* RandomizedSearchCV
* Cross-validation
* Precision / Recall / F1 evaluation

Output:

* Churn probability (0–1)
* Risk segment label

---

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric            | Value |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Accuracy          | ~98%  |
| Recall (Churn)    | ~87%  |
| Precision (Churn) | ~98%  |

Confusion Matrix:

```
[[856   3]
 [ 19 122]]
```

Primary focus: Maximize churn recall without sacrificing overall precision.

## 🚦 Risk Segmentation Logic

| Risk Level  | Probability | Business Action           |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Low Risk    | < 0.30      | Monitor                   |
| Medium Risk | 0.30 – 0.70 | Proactive outreach        |
| High Risk   | > 0.70      | Immediate retention offer |

Transforms ML output into operational strategy.

---

## ⏱️ Automation Layer

Batch pipeline:

* Load trained model
* Ingest latest snapshot
* Generate probabilities
* Apply segmentation logic
* Export business-ready CSV
* Log execution status

Scheduled daily via Windows Task Scheduler.
